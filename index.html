                    <p>Creating a will may not be the most pleasant task, but it's undeniably one of the most important
                        things you can do for yourself and your loved ones. In Queensland, having a valid will is
                        crucial to ensure your assets are distributed according to your wishes. Without one, the
                        distribution of your assets will be handled according to the state's intestacy laws, which may
                        not align with your intentions. Seeking advice from experienced <a

                                                    instructions on how you want your estate to be divided. Without a
                                                    will, the courts will decide who gets what, which might not reflect

                                                    death. This is crucial for ensuring they are cared for by someone
